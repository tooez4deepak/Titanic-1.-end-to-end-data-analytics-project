# 🚢 Titanic Data Analytics Project

### Overview  
This project was developed as part of a data analytics portfolio to present findings to a shipbuilding company.  
The main goal was to analyze the **Titanic dataset** to understand passenger survival trends and help future ship designs reduce disparities between **passenger classes** and **age groups**.

## 🧩 Project Structure  

The project is divided into **five key stages**:

### 1. Project Portfolio  
- Created a short and wide HTML portfolio page.  
- Included: project title, level, tools used, hashtags, analyst name, and professional handles (links).  

### 2. Soft Skills  
- Conducted a **kick-off meeting** with management.  
- Documented all tasks and discussions from the meeting for clarity and collaboration.  

### 3. Hard Skills  
- **Data Preparation** – Requested a data engineer to prepare and clean the Titanic dataset.  
- **SQL** – Queried and explored passenger and survival data.  
- **Python** – Used Python for data analysis and preprocessing.  

### 4. Tableau & Power BI  
- Built **interactive dashboards** showcasing:  
  - Survival rates by class and age group  
  - Comparative visuals for better understanding of data trends.  

### 5. Goals and Assessment  
- Evaluated insights derived from dashboards.  
- Assessed key findings to recommend improvements in ship safety design.

## 📊 Key Insights  
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, while third-class passengers had the lowest.  
- Children had a significantly higher survival rate compared to adults and seniors.  
- Seniors in second class had the lowest survival rate (0%).  
- Young adults made up the majority of survivors overall.
